Architectural decisions, alternatives considered, rejected assumptions,
deferred changes, and reasoning about why we chose not to act.

## DN-1: Compiler residence and fixed output-image size

**Date:** 2026-09-12 (Phase 7 close)

**Context:**

After Phase 7.4, CC_B is 63,808 bytes and OUTPUT_SIZE is 65,536 bytes
(0x10000), leaving 1,728 bytes of headroom in the compilation output
buffer.  This was initially framed as a system-memory concern.

**Decision:**

The self-hosted compiler is an ordinary Anka process, not a kernel
component and not expected to remain permanently resident.  The current
64 KiB compilation output object is a bootstrap-era implementation
choice, not a system-memory limit.  CC_B approaching that size does not
imply memory pressure for Anka as a system.

When a real client exceeds the current image size, the client should
drive the replacement abstraction.  Possible future solutions include:

- Dynamically sized output objects (compiler asks OS for allocation)
- Larger fixed images with multi-instruction address construction
- Segmented executable objects (code + literal as separate objects)

The MOVI 18-bit signed immediate (max 131,071) is the genuine
addressing constraint for literal offsets.  Simply increasing
OUTPUT_SIZE beyond that range would require multi-instruction address
generation using existing instructions (shift + OR).  No instruction 30
is necessarily required.

**Rule:**

Do not redesign the image format merely to create unused headroom.
Let a real client break the bootstrap assumption.

## DN-2: CC_A is a frozen bootstrap seed

**Date:** 2026-09-12 (Phase 7.4)

**Context:**

Phase 7.4 initially implemented `validateutf8()` in both CC_A (the Rust
AST compiler) and canonical source simultaneously.  This caused a
cascade of layout overflows: TEXT_SIZE, SOURCE_SIZE, OUTPUT_SIZE, virtual
layout order, and physical placement all had to change, breaking 17
tests.

**Decision:**

CC_A is frozen as a bootstrap seed.  Its purpose is not to be the best
compiler; its purpose is to be sufficient to construct the authoritative
one.  New compiler semantics go into canonical source and are tested
through CC_B.

This holds when the new feature uses nothing CC_A cannot already
compile, which is the case for `validateutf8()` (it uses only existing
language constructs: functions, while, if/else, comparisons, readbyte).

Future syntax changes that CC_A cannot parse will require staged
bootstrap through an older CC_B:

```text
old CC_B  →  compile new canonical source  →  new CC_B
```

rather than expecting the ancient CC_A seed to understand the new
language.

**Lesson:**

Self-hosting changed where language development happens:

- Before Phase 6B: Rust AST compiler *is* the compiler.
- After Phase 6B: Rust AST compiler = bootstrap seed.  Canonical source = compiler.

## DN-3: Lexical error must produce a terminal token

**Date:** 2026-09-12 (Phase 7.4)

**Context:**

The initial `scanstring()` implementation set `WS_ERROR = 1` on invalid
UTF-8 but left the token type stale.  Given prior stale-token parser
bugs, this risked the parser continuing with a partially valid token.

**Decision:**

Lexical failure always produces both properties:

1. **Scanner always makes progress** — advance past the closing quote
   before validation, so the scanner is never stuck at the same quote
   character.

2. **Terminal token on error** — set `TOK_TYPE = TOK_EOF` on failure,
   not just the error flag.  This guarantees the parser's
   `while (tok != EOF && error == 0)` loop terminates.

The sequence is: find closing quote, compute start/len, advance past
closing quote, validate UTF-8, then branch on valid/invalid.

## DN-4: Validation is a gate, not a transcoder

**Date:** 2026-09-12 (Phase 7.4)

**Context:**

UTF-8 validation could potentially normalize, replace invalid sequences
with U+FFFD, or perform case folding.

**Decision:**

`validateutf8()` accepts or rejects.  It never modifies bytes.  Valid
input bytes appear identically in the literal output.  This is tested
explicitly: the "Izmir" test verifies `C4 B0 7A 6D 69 72` survives
the full pipeline unchanged.

Unicode noncharacters (U+FFFF, U+FDD0, etc.) are accepted because they
are valid scalar values.  Rejecting them would impose text-content
policy, which is not the validator's job.

Normalization, escapes, grapheme segmentation, and Unicode identifiers
are deferred.  An HTTP server does not need any of them.  It needs
reliable bytes and valid text.
